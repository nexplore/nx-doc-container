# NxDocContainer

NxDocContainer is a project designed to generate a beautiful pdf document from your markdown documentation.

As a developer, you just document your project as before - and NxDocContainer generates the PDF document for your external stakeholders as project manager or test engineer.

It uses a docker container to run pandoc in the right version and the required dependency and works out of the box even on your Windows machine using Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Write your doc in markdown and add graphs using DrawIO.
- Versionize your doc along the application changes.
- Generate pdfs out of the box without dependency hell.

## Installation

To install NxDocContainer, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NxDocContainer.git
```

## Usage

### Write content

Add your documentation to the docs folder. Use images and other elements.

Optional, update meta data for the generated PDF in docs_pandoc/build.sh in the parameters.

### Generate pdf

Open the docs_pandoc folder as Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.
Optional, run "Rebuild and Reopen in Container" command.

```bash
./build.sh
```
### Generate pdf in your Azure DevOps build pipeline
